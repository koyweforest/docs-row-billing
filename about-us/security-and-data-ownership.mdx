## Integrity

* All our data servers have immediate synchronization mirrors. This means that every piece of data you save is automatically stored at multiple points to avoid a single point of failure.

## Data ownership
* We make things simple: All the data your generate belongs 100% to your company. You always have access to your data and
can request a backup and deletion at any moment. Our terms of service provide are very clear on how we store your
information and the limits on what we can do in order to provide you service.
