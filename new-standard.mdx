### About the Standard

![The Ideal State](/images/einvoice-network.png)

The E-invoice Exchange Framework, promoted by the Federal Reserve and the Business Payments Coalition, represents a significant 
step forward in modernizing business-to-business (B2B) payments in the United States.

This new standard aims to create a virtual, interoperable network that allows businesses to send and receive electronic invoices 
(e-invoices) and payment remittance information seamlessly.

By establishing a common set of standards, policies, and guidelines, the E-invoice Exchange Framework ensures compatibility across 
different platforms and systems, much like how email networks operate. Businesses can connect to an access point (service provider) 
that handles the transformation and delivery of invoice data, enabling streamlined and automated processing.

This initiative addresses key inefficiencies in the current invoicing system, reducing manual processing, minimizing errors, and 
speeding up payment cycles, thereby enhancing overall cash flow management and operational efficiency.
