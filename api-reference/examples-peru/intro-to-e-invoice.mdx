# History and mandatory status
<Note>
E-INVOICING STATUS: E-INVOICE AND E-RECEIPT ARE MANDATORY TO ALL COMPANIES
</Note>

Peru started developing the e-invoice later than other countries in the region and was able to learn from the experience of other countries. This
allowed them to use UBL formats on their XML files, and make implementation much easier and cheaper than other countries.

E-invoice became mandatory on 2018 and e-receipt in 2022.
