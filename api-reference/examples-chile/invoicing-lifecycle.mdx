# Invoice issuance lifecycle
Chile has an asynchronic invoicing system, which means that you can issue a document and send it to the
customer while the tax authority is still processing it. The effect is a higher speed and avaibility but
you must properly handle document rejections by fixing and resending rejected documents.

There are 2 validations steps, the first one is the sending validation, where the certificate and company
are checked by the tax authority and then there is a content validation where the XML is validated.

The steps are as follows, you can identify them by using GET /documents and reading the fields.

# GET /documents/\{document_id\}

## 1) Draft
```json
{
    "header": {
      "document_status" : 0
    }
}
```

## 2) Issued, pending validation
```json
{
    "header": {
    "document_status" : 1
    }
}
```

The document has all required fields and was issued by our system, it will be sent to the tax authority
in a few minutes. No action is required on your side.

## 3) Succesfully Sent to tax authority (SII) and content being processed
```json
{
    "header": {
        "document_status" : 1,
        "taxbureau_send_status": 1,
        "taxbureau_send_id": "XXXXXX",
        "taxbureau_send_date": "AAAA-MM-DD"
  }
}
```

The document was automatically sent to the tax authority. No action is required on your side.

## 3B) Sending rejected by tax authority (SII)
```json
{
    "header": {
        "document_status" : 1,
        "taxbureau_send_status": "XXX"
    }
}
```

**Temporal error**
Send status codes 101 to 110 are temporal errors where we will wait 5 minutes and retry.

No action is required on your side in this case.

**Permanent error**
Send status codes 201 to 206 are permanent errors where no further retries will be made.

- 201 = Digital certificate not allowed to send documents
- 202, 203, 206 = Incorrect data sent
- 204 = Digital certificate revoked
- 205 = Company not allowed to send documents

The document must be issued and sent again in this case.

## 4) Content Approved by tax authority (SII)
```json
{
    "header": {
        "document_status" : 1,
        "taxbureau_send_status": 1,
        "taxbureau_send_id": "XXXXXX",
        "taxbureau_send_date": "AAAA-MM-DD",
        "taxbureau_validation_status": 3
    }
}
```

The document has completed its cycle succesfully, no further action is required.

## 4B) Content Approved by tax authority (SII) with observations
```json
{
    "header": {
        "document_status" : 1,
        "taxbureau_send_status": 1,
        "taxbureau_send_id": "XXXXXX",
        "taxbureau_send_date": "AAAA-MM-DD",
        "taxbureau_validation_status": 4,
        "taxbureau_validation_comments": "XXXXXX"
    }
}
```

The document was accepted but there were some minor issues. You will find additional information on the
comments field. No further actions is required.


## 4C) Content Rejected by tax authority (SII)
```json
{
    "header": {
        "document_status" : 1,
        "taxbureau_send_status": 1,
        "taxbureau_send_id": "XXXXXX",
        "taxbureau_send_date": "AAAA-MM-DD",
        "taxbureau_validation_status": 5,
        "taxbureau_validation_comments": "XXXXX"
    }
}
```

The document was rejected, you will find further information on the comments field.

The document must be issued and sent again in this case.
