# Invoice issuance lifecycle
Chile has an asynchronic invoicing system, which means that you can issue a document and send it to the
customer while the tax authority is still processing it. The effect is a higher speed and avaibility but
you must properly handle document rejections by fixing and resending rejected documents.

The steps are as follow, you can identify them by using GET /documents and reading the fields.

# GET /documents/\{document_id\}

## 1) Draft
```json
{
    "header": {
      "document_status" : 0
    }
}
```

## 2) Issued
```json
{
    "header": {
    "document_status" : 1
    }
}
```

The document has all required fields and was issued by our system, it will be sent to the tax authority
in a few minutes. No action is required on your side.

## 3) Succesfully Sent to tax authority (SII) and being processed
```json
{
    "header": {
        "document_status" : 1,
        "taxbureau_send_status": 1,
        "taxbureau_send_id": "XXXXXX",
        "taxbureau_send_date": "AAAA-MM-DD"
  }
}
```

The document was automatically sent to the tax authority. No action is required on your side.

## 3B) Sending rejected by tax authority (SII)
```json
{
    "header": {
        "document_status" : 1,
        "taxbureau_send_status": "XXX"
    }
}
```

Send status codes 1XX are temporal errors where we will wait 5 minutes and retry.  No action is required on your side
in this case.

Send status codes 2XX are permanent errors where no further retries will be made. The document must
be issued and sent again in this case.

201 = Digital certificate not allowed to send documents

202, 203, 206 = Incorrect data sent

204 = Digital certificate revoked

205 = Company not allowed to send documents


## 4) Approved by tax authority
```json
{
    "header": {
        "document_status" : 1,
        "taxbureau_send_status": 1,
        "taxbureau_send_id": "XXXXXX",
        "taxbureau_send_date": "AAAA-MM-DD",
        "taxbureau_validation_status": 3
    }
}
```

The document has completed its cycle succesfully, no further action is required.

## 4B) Approved by tax authority with observations
```json
{
    "header": {
        "document_status" : 1,
        "taxbureau_send_status": 1,
        "taxbureau_send_id": "XXXXXX",
        "taxbureau_send_date": "AAAA-MM-DD",
        "taxbureau_validation_status": 4,
        "taxbureau_validation_comments": "XXXXXX"
    }
}
```

The document was accepted but there were some minor issues. You will find additional information on the
comments field. No further actions is required.


## 4C) Rejected by tax authority
```json
{
    "header": {
        "document_status" : 1,
        "taxbureau_send_status": 1,
        "taxbureau_send_id": "XXXXXX",
        "taxbureau_send_date": "AAAA-MM-DD",
        "taxbureau_validation_status": 5,
        "taxbureau_validation_comments": "XXXXX"
    }
}
```

The document was rejected, you will find further information on the comments field. The document must
be issued and sent again in this case.
