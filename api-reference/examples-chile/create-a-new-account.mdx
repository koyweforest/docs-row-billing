In order to create a new chilean account, you will need to send the chilean digital certificate as an additional field on PFX format encoded as base64,
as this is a requirement to issue electronic invoices. Remember to get the token from the /auth endpoint first.

The certificate_file must be in PFX binary format, encoded as base64.

* Method: POST
* Required headers:
    * Content-Type: application/json
    * Authorization: Bearer \<token\>
    * Accept: \*/\*
