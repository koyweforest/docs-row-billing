Our API allows you generate digital certificate links for you or your customers. Once generated, the customer must enter
the link and validate his identity online, in order to get the certificate PFX file and use it to authenticate on the SII
website or issue electronic invoices. Remember to get the token from the /auth endpoint first.

IMPORTANT: Issuing digital certificates has an additional cost. Please contact us previously so we can enable your account to
use this endpoint.
