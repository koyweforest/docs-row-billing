# History and mandatory status
<Note>
E-INVOICING STATUS: BOTH E-INVOICE AND E-RECEIPT ARE MANDATORY TO ALL COMPANIES
</Note>

The electronic invoice was created in 2002 as a pilot program. Chile was one of the worldwide pioneers in this technology
so the chilean XML formats are very different from other countries.

E-invoice became mandatory on 2018, and e-receipt in 2021.
