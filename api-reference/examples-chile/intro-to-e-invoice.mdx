# History and mandatory status
<Note>
E-INVOICING STATUS: BOTH E-INVOICE AND E-RECEIPT ARE MANDATORY TO ALL COMPANIES
</Note>

The electronic invoice was created in 2002 as a pilot program. Chile was one of the worldwide pioneers in this technology
so the chilean XML formats are very different from other countries.

E-invoice became mandatory on 2018, and e-receipt in 2021.

# Taxes
The main indirect tax in Chile is the IVA (VAT) with a single 19% value and no local variations. Most products and services are
subject to VAT.

There are additional taxes to alcohol, tobacco, etc that can be included on invoices along with VAT.

# Local Requirements to operate
* Digital certificate for the legal representative of the company (legal representative needs to have a chilean RUT tax id)
* RUT tax id issued by the SII for the company
* Operations start certificate issued by the SII (Inicio de actividades)
* Activities and address checked by the SII (Comprobación de actividades and Comprobación de domicilio)
* Finally, your company will need to go through a certification process that we will complete for you (4 to 5 business days).
There are independent certification processes for e-invoice and e-receipt but they can be completed in parallel.
