# History and mandatory status
<Note>
E-INVOICING STATUS: E-INVOICE is OPTIONAL
</Note>

USA is one of the countries that has lagged the most on developing and implementing electronic invoice,
as a lot of outdated technology like faxes or paper checks are still widely used, generating huge costs on manual
processing of sales and expenses.

On 2022 the Federal Reserve supported the creation of BPC, a technical committee led by industry, to define both document
and exchange standards for the US, and on 2023 a second project started on e-remmitance.

Both ended succesfully, generating a UBL based american
standard to be used nationwide and a governance schema for the exchange network based on DBNA, a non-profit that include
different key industry members. This is very different from what we have seen in other countries where the tax authority
regulates and controls the exchange networks.

On 2024, DBNA released its platform for public invoice exchange, allowing all companies to start using this new technology.

### About the Standard

![The Ideal State](/images/einvoice-network.png)

The E-invoice Exchange Framework, promoted by the Federal Reserve and the Business Payments Coalition, represents a significant
step forward in modernizing business-to-business (B2B) payments in the United States.

This new standard aims to create a virtual, interoperable network that allows businesses to send and receive electronic invoices
(e-invoices) and payment remittance information seamlessly.

By establishing a common set of standards, policies, and guidelines, the E-invoice Exchange Framework ensures compatibility across
different platforms and systems, much like how email networks operate. Businesses can connect to an access point (service provider)
that handles the transformation and delivery of invoice data, enabling streamlined and automated processing.

This initiative addresses key inefficiencies in the current invoicing system, reducing manual processing, minimizing errors, and
speeding up payment cycles, thereby enhancing overall cash flow management and operational efficiency.
