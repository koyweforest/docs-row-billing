# History and mandatory status
<Note>
E-INVOICING STATUS: E-INVOICE IS MANDATORY TO ALL COMPANIES
</Note>

Colombia started on 2015 developing the e-invoice and was able to learn from the experience of other countries. This
allowed them to use UBL formats on their XML files, and make implementation much easier and cheaper than other countries.

E-invoice became mandatory on 2019.
