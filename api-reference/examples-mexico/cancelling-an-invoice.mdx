In Mexico, there is no credit note document, therefore in order to cancel a sale, you can either a) cancel the document itself, or
b) create an expense invoice.

If you want to cancel it, you must use the same document_id generated during the issuing process. You
can only cancel documents in issued status (document_status = 1)

## Endpoint: /documents/\<document_id\>
* Method: PUT
* Required headers:
    * Content-Type: application/json
    * Authorization: Bearer -token-
    * Accept: */*

```json
{
  "document_status": "2"
}
```
