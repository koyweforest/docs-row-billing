Remember to generate the document first, as you will need the document_id as a required parameter.

## Endpoint: /payments
* Method: POST
* Required headers:
    * Content-Type: application/json
    * Authorization: Bearer \<token\>
    * Accept: \*/\*

"payment_type_id" : "1",
"payment_amount" : "10000",
"payment_details" : "",
