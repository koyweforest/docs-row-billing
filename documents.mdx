The new **E-invoice Exchange Framework** is designed to facilitate the efficient exchange of e-invoices 
and payment remittance information through a standardized, interoperable network.

At its core, the framework operates similarly to email networks, where service providers act as access 
points to deliver and receive data for their clients. Businesses engage with their chosen e-invoice provider, 
which then transforms the invoice data into a standard format compliant with the exchange framework.

This standard format ensures that invoices can be seamlessly processed and understood by any other access point within the network.

The framework supports various document types and communication protocols, enabling flexibility and adaptability 
for different business needs. Key documents include the e-invoice itself, which contains all the necessary transaction 
details, and e-remittance information, which provides detailed payment data.

Communication protocols within the framework ensure secure and reliable data transfer, maintaining the confidentiality 
and integrity of business transactions. By leveraging these standardized documents and protocols, businesses can achieve 
straight-through processing, reducing the need for manual intervention and speeding up payment cycles.

### The Documents

The E-invoice Exchange Framework facilitates the exchange of standardized electronic invoices (e-invoices) and electronic remittance (e-remittance) documents, ensuring interoperability across different platforms and systems.

  An e-invoice is a structured digital document that contains detailed information about a transaction. It includes:
  * **Header**: Contains essential details like invoice number, date, supplier, and buyer information.
  * **Line Items**: Lists each item or service provided, including descriptions, quantities, unit prices, and totals.
  * **Summary**: Provides an overall summary of the invoice, including total amounts, taxes, and payment terms.

  An e-remittance document accompanies the payment, detailing how the payment corresponds to the specific invoices. It includes:

  * **Payment Details**: Information about the payment, such as the amount, date, and method.
  * **Invoice References**: Links the payment to specific invoices, ensuring accurate application of funds.
  * **Deductions and Adjustments**: Any discounts, deductions, or adjustments related to the payment.
  * **Communication Protocols**: The exchange framework uses secure and standardized communication protocols to 
  ensure reliable and confidential data transfer. These protocols facilitate the seamless exchange of e-invoices 
  and e-remittance information between different access points (service providers), ensuring that businesses can 
  connect once and communicate with any other participant in the network.
